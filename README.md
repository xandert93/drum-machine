# drum-machine
Mobile-first React application. Built with Stateful Class Components, Stateless Functional Components, the Class Fields syntax, the Context API, Refs, Error boundaries, Lifecycle Methods, HTML Audio API, CSS Flexbox Grid, Font Awesome and basic SASS + BEM.

# issues
- unable to have both "keyup" and "click" functionality without repeating Window event listeners in all drumpad components
- struggled with landscape media queries
- ".app" container not wholly scrollable at smaller viewports
